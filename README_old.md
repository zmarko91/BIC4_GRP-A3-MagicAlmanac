### TODO

#### VueJS

Implement your [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) components in the folder ```/resources/js/components```.
Register your components in ```/resources/js/app.js``` and use them in the following files:

 * ```/resources/views/kind```
     * ```/resources/views/kind/create.blade.php```
     * ```/resources/views/kind/edit.blade.php```
     * ```/resources/views/kind/index.blade.php```
     * ```/resources/views/kind/show.blade.php```
 * ```/resources/views/spell```
      * ```/resources/views/spell/create.blade.php```
      * ```/resources/views/spell/edit.blade.php```
      * ```/resources/views/spell/index.blade.php```
      * ```/resources/views/spell/search.blade.php```
      * ```/resources/views/spell/show.blade.php```
      
To query data for dropdowns in forms or to reload lists use the list routes:
 * **GET** ```/list/spell```
 * **GET** ```/list/kind```
 
For the search form use ```q``` as the name for the text input.
The search will be handled by the backend.

#### CSS (SCSS)

The design of the software need to be adapted.
[Bulma](https://bulma.io) is used to layout and style the website.
If wanted default styles can be overwritten by setting variables in the ```/resources/sass/_variables.scss``` file.
Also it is possible to write custom styles in ```/resources/sass/_custom.scss```.

A new logo need to be set. If pictures will be present on the website place them in ```/public/img``` folder.
Here you will also find the logo.

### Hints

#### JavaScript and CSS (SCSS)

To compile scss and JavaScript ```npm run dev``` need to be executed in the project folder.
It is also possible to run ```npm run watch``` so it is not need to execute ```npm run dev``` every time a change happend. 

#### Data for Database

To make starting developing fast there are some seeders implemented to fill all needed tables except the user table.
To populate the database run the command ```php artisan db:seed``` in the terminal in project root folder.
